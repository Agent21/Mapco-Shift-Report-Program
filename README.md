#General Info

The Mapco Shift Report program was designed to help mapco cashiers fill out their shift reports with maximum speed and ease. This program is written OOP-style and does not feature a GUI. To run the program, users MUST at least have Python installed on their computer. An .exe version has also been created using py2exe for quick use. 

Although this program is technically "working", it has many flaws such as the ability to enter incorrect information (such as numbers with more than 2 numbers after the decimal) and the inability to go back and change this information. Therefore, all
information that is labeled "valid" by the program must also be logically correct. Assuming this is done, the program will work accordingly. Later on down the road, this program will quite possibly receive improvements along that way that shall address the problems mentioned above as well as other additions listed on my imaginary "wishlist". This wishlist includes features like: A menu system for easy navigation and custom work flow, the ability to read from files, and the ability to save/read .csv/excel files.

As of now, this program is only tailored for employees whose store is using the POS register system. Those who use the BP register system will find it hard to get through this program. In the future I may make it easier for those who are on the BP system to use this program, however the shift report is already easy to fill out due to the safe and safe drop log being calculated for them.
